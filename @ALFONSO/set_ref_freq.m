function set_ref_freq( this, varargin )
%SET_REF_FREQ sets the ppm reference by setting acq_window_center_ppm in
% scanparam
%   set_ref_freq( ppm=1.3 ) sets the ppm reference based on the largest present
%       peak in the first dynamic - in this case the largest peak is
%       shifted to 1.3 ppm (e.g. meaningful if methylene if largest peak)
%   set_ref_freq( 'autoset-waterfat', ppm=1.3 ) tries to set the ppm
%       reference based on the methylene peak in the first dynamic.
%       Additionally, a look around for a water-peak is performed and considered.
%       The spectrum is shifted according to the methylene peak to 1.3 ppm.
%
%   Parameters: 
%    - reconparam.set_ref_freq.defaults.mode = ['simple'
%      |Â 'autoset-waterfat'] sets working mode:
%       - simple: sets largest peak to the passed ppm value
%       - autoset-waterfat: tries to set reference based on the methylene
%       peak to the passed ppm value. Method tries to compensate for the
%       presence of a large water peak. 
%    - reconparam.set_ref_freq.defaults.autoset_waterfat.lookaround_distance_ppm
%      = ppm range (float) expected offset (in ppm) between water and fat peak
%    - reconparam.set_ref_freq.defaults.autoset_waterfat.lookaround_range_ppm 
%      = ppm range (float) ppm range within which water / peak is expected
%    - reconparam.set_ref_freq.defaults.autoset_waterfat.noise_level_factor
%      = (float) noise level factor which used to calculate the peak 
%      threshold: peak_noise_level = mean(noise) + noise_level_factor * 
%      SD(noise)
%    - reconparam.set_ref_freq.defaults.autoset_waterfat.noise_meas_range
%      = [0-1] (float) relative length (rel. to total spectrum) used to 
%      determin noise level
